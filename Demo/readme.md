# Demo Tool

Our team developed two demo tools to address the recommendations brought forth during the presentation.
Both demo tools load the XGBoost model we developed, as well as the linear projections through time horizons.

1. The Right Price
The Demo tool "The Right Price" dynamically predicts the price, cost and profits of any given address in Ile De France, for any given time horizon, and building specifications.
The tool even include potential "rental revenues" that can be made possible after 4 years.

2. The Right Place
While prospecting, one of the challenges is to identify on which areas to focus on. That is where "The Right Place" comes in handy, as it searches for the approximate locations (based on zipcodes) in which the expected profits are the highest, given input specifications (time horizon, square meters, number of apartments, etc.)
Similarly to the previous demo tool, this tool includes potential "rental revenues" that can be made possible after 4 years.
